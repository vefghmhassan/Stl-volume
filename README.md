# Stl-volume
The Go code snippet calculates volume, weight, and density of 3D models from STL files, supporting both ASCII and binary formats. It features `STLCalc` for file analysis, incorporating methods for reading, volume computation, and density adjustment, useful in 3D printing and CAD applications.
